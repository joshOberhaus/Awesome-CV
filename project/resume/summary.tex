\begin{cvparagraph}
    With 8 years specializing in Driver Assistance, I bring expertise in Radar-based
    tracking and fusion, alongside a diverse skill set from a total of 14 years in the automotive industry.
    Committed to ongoing learning and empowering colleagues: I've revamped visualization tools, introduced two generations of tracking KPI tools, and conducted various training sessions on perception and fusion all to make working on tracking more accessible and enjoyable.
    
    I'm a strong team player which I've demonstrated through leading critical customer meetings and stepping into the role of Product Owner as needed.
