    With nine years specializing in Driver Assistance, I bring expertise in Radar-based
    tracking and fusion, alongside a diverse skill set developed from a total of 15 years in the automotive industry.
    Committed to ongoing learning while also empowering colleagues; I have revamped visualization tools, introduced two generations of tracking KPI tools, and conducted various training sessions on perception and fusion - all to make working on tracking more accessible and enjoyable. I am strong team player, as demonstrated by leading critical customer meetings and stepping into the role of Product Owner as needed. I am eager to contribute to a new team!
